# Quasi-Stationary Waves (QSW) and Extreme Cold Events on the Pacific Coast

Copyright (C) 2025 Nazia Edroos

This repository contains the code I wrote to analyze ERA5 data in order to answer the question: **Is the relationship between high-amplitude QSWs and extreme cold events on the Pacific Coast changing over time according to historical observations, 1979-2022?**

## Method Overview:
### Part 1: Annual Mann-Kendall Trends in North America:
 1. QSW Values
 2. 90th percentile *high-amplitude* QSW values
 3. 90th percentile *high-amplitude persistent* QSWs; frequency and length

### Part 2: Daily Minimum Temperatures occurring at the same time as Pacific Coast 90th percentile high-amplitude QSWs
 1. Anomaly in mean daily minimum temperatures in comparison to 1979-2022 climatology
 2. Anomaly in annual trend of mean daily minimum temperatures in comparison to 1979-2022 trend

### Part 3: Anomaly in mean number of cold wave days occurring at the same time as Pacific Coast 90th percentile high-amplitude QSWs
